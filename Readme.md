Cleaner Redmine
===============

**Make [Redmine][] digestible.**

[![Screenshot](Screenshot.png)][social]

The default look of [Redmine][] makes it difficult to find important info. This set of CSS overrides improves the ugliest bits of Redmine.

Here’s what you get:

* more air, less cramp
* less visual clutter
* pleasing aesthetics

Usage
-----

I’ve found no tool for Chrome to pull a custom stylesheet from the filesystem and apply it to specific pages.

The least annoying thing I’ve found is [stylebot][]. You can [install this style][social] from their styles repository – I do my best to keep it up to date.

Compatibility
-------------

Honestly speaking, I have no idea what version of Redmine this is compatible with. I just keep it up-to-date with my install.

**A modern touch to [Redmine][].**  
**Optimized for productivity.**

A custom stylesheet to override the ugliest bits of [Redmine][].

Usage
-----

I’ve found no tool for Chrome to pull a custom stylesheet from the filesystem and apply it to specific pages.

The least annoying thing I’ve found is [stylebot][]. You can [install this style][social] from their styles repository – I do my best to keep it up to date.

[social]:    http://stylebot.me/styles/10068




Compatibility
-------------

Honestly speaking, I have no idea what version of Redmine this is compatible with. I just keep it up-to-date with my install of Redmine.
